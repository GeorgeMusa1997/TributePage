            <cite>"Every self-respecting coach should manage Real Madrid sometime in their life. In my experience, it is the greatest thing in the world - a very nice, almost unique experience.What happens in Madrid does not happen at any other club, the worldwide support is breathtaking. Everywhere we appeared - hotels, airports, stadiums - were full of fans, it is an experience worth living."
